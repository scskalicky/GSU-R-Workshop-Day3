> Kim, Y., Jung, Y., & Skalicky, S. (2019). Linguistic alignment, learner characteristics, and the production of stranded prepositions in relative clauses. *Studies in Second Language Acquisition*, *41*(5), 937â€“969.

This research compared the degree of **primed production** of English stranded prepositions among Korean learners of English. Learners completed an alignment session, where half of their input trials included a stranded preposition, and half did not. After each trial, we assessed whether the participants produced (or did not produce) a stranded preposition. If a participant produced a stranded preposition after an input trial containing a stranded preposition, this was taken as evidence of alignment. We also measured the degree of **learning** of stranded prepositions from the alignment sessions using a pre/immediate/delayed posttest design. These two questions are further nested within a comparison of **modality**: half of the participants completed the alignment session in a face-to-fact (FTF) context, whereas the other half completed the session in a synchronous computer-mediated context (SCMC). A separate control condition only completed the pre/immediate/delayed posttests and did not participate in the alignment sessions. 

As such there are two main analyses: 

    1. What is the degree of linguistic alignment, and are there differences between FTF/SCMC modality?
    2. Does the alignment session lead to learning of stranded prepositions, and are there differences between FTF/SCMC modality?

We answered both questions using *logistic regression*, which determines the probability of a binary outcome (yes/no, accurate/innacurate, etc) based on independent variables (modality, pre/post, etc.).

These anlayses are split over the two analysis folders in this repository.
